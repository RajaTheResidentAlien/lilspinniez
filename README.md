# lilspinniez
lil thing i made using 'shado' by Nick Rothwell(https://github.com/cassiel/shado)

from within maiden, under 'matron' tab, type:
>;install https://github.com/RajaTheResidentAlien/lilspinniez

from there, it works like a game of whack-a-mole, try and hit within the lit area
and it will trigger sounds to go through reverb(as of v1.0 now 1/6/2022)
